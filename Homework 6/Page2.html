        <h1>The Ugly Duckling</h1>

        <p>Once upon a time, in a quiet pond with tall plants and pretty flowers around it, a mother duck waited excitedly for her eggs to hatch. Finally, the day came when one egg cracked open, and out came a tiny, grayish duckling.</p>
        
        <p>"My dear, you may not be as pretty as your siblings, but you are just as special," she said, giving the duckling lots of love.</p>
        
        <p>But as the days passed, the little duckling noticed that the other ducklings made fun of him because he looked different. Feeling sad and alone, he decided to leave the pond and find a place where he could belong.</p>
        
        <p>He traveled through fields and woods, hoping to find friends who would accept him for who he was. Along the way, he met other animals who wondered about his different look.</p>
        
        <p>"You don't look like us," said the rabbits.</p>
        
        <p>"Why are you so gray?" asked the bluebirds.</p>
        
        <p>The little duckling felt sad with every question, but he kept going, hoping to find his real home.</p>
        
        <p>As autumn came, he found a beautiful lake shining in the sunlight. There, he saw a group of beautiful swans swimming on the water, their wings shining like silver.</p>
        
        <p>Enchanted by their beauty, the little duckling went to them. But as he got closer, he was unsure, remembering how he had been treated before. He was afraid the swans would not want him too.</p>
        
        <p>To his surprise, the swans welcomed him. "Hello there, little friend. You are welcome to join us," said the kindest swan.</p>
